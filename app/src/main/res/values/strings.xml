    <string name="stoop">India’s oldest stone structure, commissioned into existence by Emperor Ashoka and built over the remains of Buddha in a glorious endeavor to honour them, Sanchi Stupa is a magnificent exemplar of not just Buddhist and Mauryan art and architecture, but also of faith and reverence. While its foundation was overlain by Emperor Ashoka in 3rd century BCE, it was actually his wife, Queen Devi, a native of Sanchi, who eventually oversaw its establishment.


The initial structure was half the size of the present edifice, enclosed with railings made of wood and crowned with a stone umbrella-like structure, known as chatra that symbolises high rank. Gradually, over the centuries that followed and as different dynasties crossed its path, the Stupa and the region surrounding it grew and developed into the grand, illustrious heritage site that it is now.


A World Heritage site, Sanchi Stupaessentially refers to Stupa 1, known more fittingly as the Great Stupa. Surrounding it is Stupa 3, the Ashokan pillar, Temple 18 from the Mauryan era and Temple 17 belonging to the Gupta era. There are a number of other temples and monuments strewn across the village of Sanchi, dating from the times of the dynasties that reigned over the region, beginning from 3rd century BCE to 12th century CE.


Chiseled with a number of Brahmi inscriptions that date back to the 3rd century BCE, leading up to 800 CE, Sanchi Stupa is not surprisingly a site of immense religious and historical significance for the Buddhist faith followers. As you explore in awe and excitement the monument scattered landscape of Sanchi, and walk up to the Great Stupa, be sure to peer closely at the four gateways that surround it and open out to it. Built in the first century BC by Andhra-Satavahanas, these four gateways represent love, courage, trust and peace and are carved intricately with events and scenes from Buddha’s life. </string>
